# Group_5_Software-Engineering_Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for our software engineering group project. 

Team members are:
Siddharth Dhola(SD23T), 
Kedar Awale(KA23L)
Sanskar Chouhan(SC23BQ)

In this project we are implementing the following questions on DevGPT dataset(version snapshot_20231012):
1. What types of issues (bugs, feature requests, theoretical questions and security.) do developers most commonly present to ChatGPT?
2. What are the most common types of prompts (Single turn, multi turn and contextual prompts) that developers use when interacting with ChatGPT?
3. What are the most common use cases (Content generation, Information retrieval, Natural language understanding and Language translation) for which developers turn to ChatGPT for assistance?

- Our dataset link:

## File structure: 

- We have uploaded three files named "Research Question 1.py", "Research Question 2.py" and "Research Question 3.py" for the above-given research questions 1,2, and 3 respectively.

- We have attached one folder named "Results" which contains all the outputs of our three models with the given dataset.

- In the "Results" folder, we have also created three separate folders for the three different models to store their outputs.
