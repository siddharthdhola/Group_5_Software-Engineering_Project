In this project we are implementing the following questions on DevGPT dataset(version snapshot_20231012):
1. What types of issues (bugs, feature requests, theoretical questions and security.) do developers most commonly present to ChatGPT?
2. What are the most common types of prompts (Single turn, multi turn and contextual prompts) that developers use when interacting with ChatGPT?
3. What are the most common use cases (Content generation, Information retrieval, Natural language understanding and Language translation) for which developers turn to ChatGPT for assistance?

The dataset we used is as follows:
